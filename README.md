yes N's didn't wanted you to find the secret name

# Informations

You can read a detailed article about it [here](https://switchbrew.org/w/index.php?title=BCAT_services)

the program will look for custom news in sdmc:/bcat and the backup will be done into sdmc:/NewsBackup!

## IMPORTANT!

Actually this homebrew dosen't have a proper backup method to dump the original news to a specified folder, so it's heavily suggested to not install the custom news unless you have a backup

See /example folder for them
