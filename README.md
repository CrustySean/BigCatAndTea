# BigCatAndTea (BCAT)

Just a funny name, not the real one.

# Informations

You can read a detailed article about BCAT services [here](https://switchbrew.org/w/index.php?title=BCAT_services)

the program will look for custom news in sdmc:/News and the backup will be done into sdmc:/NewsBackup!

## IMPORTANT!

~~Actually this homebrew dosen't have a proper backup method to dump the original news to a specified folder, so it's heavily suggested to not install the custom news unless you have a backup~~ not anymore :^)


## Disclaimer

You're the only responasbile for the things you'll do with this app, use it at your own risk!
