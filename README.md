# BigCatAndTea (BCAT)

yes N's didn't wanted you to find the secret name

## IMPORTANT!

Actually this homebrew dosen't have a proper backup method to dump the original news to a specified folder, so it's heavily suggested to not install the custom news unless you have a backup

See /example folder for them

## Disclaimer

You're the only responasbile for the things you'll do with this app, use it at your own risk!

the program will look for custom news in sdmc:/bcat

## Compiling

To compile this project you would need to download the latest libnx from github.

`git clone https://github.com/switchbrew/libnx.git`

`cd libnx`

`make install`

_this will take some times_
